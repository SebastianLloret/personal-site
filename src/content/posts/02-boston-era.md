## signs of life
i'm alive! things have been on pause for longer than expected as i've settled into a new rhythm on the east coast. driving over 3,000 miles in 4 days was an intense experience! my pet rabbit handled it better than i'd hoped. no idea how old he is at this point as a rescue, but with time's passage he's gotten so much calmer about car rides. unfortunately my poor corolla took on some minor aesthetic damage on the road, but nothing some elbow grease can't fix. it's weird to think i've owned it for so many years and never changed the oil, a tire, or any of the basic maintenance tasks that come with owning a car.

## first impressions
for someone born and raised in the aleatory urban sprawl of SoCal, things couldn't be more different geographically. i knew from visiting that walking/cycling is often the most effective form of transit in the area, but living here takes it to a different level entirely. don't think i'll ever get used to a 3 mile drive being a 20 minute drive *without traffic*. at the same time, everything you could realistically need is within a half-mile: groceries, pharmacies, hair salons, etc. the amount of space that's available when a municipality doesn't design around cars boggles the mind. the other day i walked to buy some olive oil and other staples, and it brought me back to trudging across a highway in the rain and snow in upstate NY because i didn't have a car yet. i remembered the hit and run i witnessed in boulder, co that wouldn't have even been possible in the twisting safety corridors of the greater boston metro. how are you going to speed off through such a tangle of cars and concrete? i could talk about just this at length, but i'll end the thought by pointing people to look up the "general motors streetcar conspiracy".

## making room for plants that don't need water
one of the biggest lessons i've learned during this move is the importance of surrounding myself with people who don't drain my energy. just like plants that thrive with minimal watering, there are relationships that flourish without constant maintenance. it's been enlightening to recognize who in my life adds value and positivity without needing constant attention.

in the hustle and bustle of settling into a new place, it's easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of activities and obligations. but taking a step back, i've realized the importance of investing in connections that are mutually enriching. it's about finding that balanceâ€”just as a well-curated garden includes both hardy perennials and delicate blooms, our social circles can benefit from a mix of low-maintenance, yet deeply rooted, relationships.

moving to boston has provided a unique opportunity to reevaluate these connections. the city itself is a blend of old and new, a testament to resilience and adaptation. it's a reminder that just as we tend to our physical environments, we must also cultivate our social landscapes with care. surrounding ourselves with those who support our growth and well-being without constant demands is crucial for a balanced and fulfilling life. here's to finding beauty and strength in simplicity and to thriving in an environment that supports our natural rhythms and needs.
